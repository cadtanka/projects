# Projects
Hello! I am a junior attending the University of Washington. These are the projects that I've completed during my time at university

PROJECT INFO: 

Bot_Project: Created through personal research and YouTube tutorials ("Relaxing Leg" on YT). Programmed in Java
  Functions: Simple arithmetic, ban or promote members, join discord calls, play a desired song, present survey questions, display information 

Campus Paths: This program displays a map of the University of Washington and allows the user to select two buildings from the dropdown menu. The shortest distance between the two buildings is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm, and the path is displayed via a line on the map. Programmed in React and Java

Poly: A fully functioning calculator that can do arithmetic with complex numbers. Programmed in Java

Vaccine Scheduler: Using a database and encryption, patients and doctors can create personal accounts. A client can create an appointment with available doctors on any day given they are available. Doctors can also access their own schedules. The stock of vaccines are also kept track of, and appointments will not be issued if not enough of a certain vaccine is available. 

Math 381 Group Project - Worked with a cargo company to develop an algorithm to more efficiently pack shipping containers
